### 4.4 Disclosure Method

Base model and license information must be provided:

- During the submission process through the designated disclosure fields
- In a `model_card.md` file accompanying Your submission
- In model metadata following the Hugging Face Model Card format

---

## 5. Required License for Submitted Models

### 5.1 MIT License Requirement

All models submitted to Subnet 46 MUST be licensed under the **MIT License**. The validator automatically verifies this by checking the HuggingFace model card metadata.

### 5.2 License Setup on HuggingFace

When hosting Your Submitted Materials on HuggingFace, You MUST:

a) **Set License:** Select **MIT** from the license dropdown when creating your model repository.

b) **Optional LICENSE File:** You may also include a LICENSE file with the standard MIT license text, but the model card metadata is what the validator checks.

### 5.3 Verification Process

The validator performs automated license verification:
- Fetches model card metadata from the HuggingFace API
- Performs a case-insensitive check for "mit" in the license field
- Rejects models with `LicenseError` if MIT license is not detected

### 5.4 Why MIT License?

The MIT License requirement ensures:
- Models can be freely used, modified, and distributed
- Clear and simple terms for all participants
- Compatibility with the open-source Bittensor ecosystem
- No ambiguity about usage rights

### 5.5 Compliance Verification

RESI reserves the right to:
- Verify that Your HuggingFace repositories contain the correct license metadata
- Request You update or correct licensing information within 7 days
- Remove Your models from Subnet 46 if licensing is incorrect or missing
- Terminate Your account for repeated licensing violations
