**IF INFORMAL RESOLUTION FAILS, YOU AND RESI AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, NOT IN COURT.**

- Neither you nor RESI may bring claims as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative action
- The arbitrator has no authority to conduct class or collective proceedings or make awards to any person other than you individually

**If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable for any reason, the entire arbitration agreement (Section 16.2) is void, and disputes will be resolved in court per Section 16.7.**
